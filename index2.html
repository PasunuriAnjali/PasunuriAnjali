            <h1 class="title"> The Life of B.R AMBEDKAR</h1>
            <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee 
                </p>drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, 
                </p>and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he 
                </p>entered Elphinstone College, which was affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. 
                </p>When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached
                </p>"great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to
                </p>celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the 
                </p>author and a family friend.Since 1948, Ambedkar had diabetes. He remained in bed from June to October in 1954 due to medication side-effects and 
                </p>poor eyesight.His health worsened during 1955. Three days after completing his final manuscript The Buddha and His Dhamma, Ambedkar died in
                </p>his sleep on 6 December 1956 at his home in Delhi.</p></div>
